Schedule and Agenda for Oral Presentations:
-------------------------------------------

**Agenda Item** | **Time Allocated**
--------------- | ----------------
Government Provides Questions to Offeror | Approximately 60 Minutes Prior to Oral Presentation (via e-mail)
Introductions | Approximately 5 Minutes
Offeror Orals - Q&A on Technical Factors | 25 Minutes Maximum
Break for Offeror & Government Questions | 5 Minutes Maximum
Government Follow-Up Q&A | 15 Minutes Maximum (if needed)                                

*a.* *Rules.* The oral presentation consists of an initial question and answer session on technical factors, and a follow-up question and answer session (if necessary), associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR part 15. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, and solicit or allow revised quotes. The entire oral presentation will be conducted remotely via video and audio. Offerors shall not bring or present slides, graphs, charts or any other written presentation materials nor will the Government accept or receive offeror handouts.

*b.* *Part One.* Part One of the offeror’s oral presentation will consist of the offeror answering the Government’s core questions related to the technical factors identified in the Request For Quotation (RFQ). While the technical factors are identified in the RFQ, the core questions are not. All offerors will be asked the same core questions related to the technical factors. The questions are related to the offeror’s technical understanding and approach of the requirements identified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and quality control measures for overseeing performance. This part of the oral presentation of answers will not exceed 25 minutes, and may go shorter.

*c.* *Part Two (only if necessary).* The Government will allocate 15 minutes for follow-up questions following the offeror’s answers to the initial core questions on technical factors. During this time, the Government may ask questions on any information that had been presented by the offeror that the Government feels is unclear or needs elaboration. The Government’s questions may differ among the offerors based on what needs elaboration. If the Government has no follow-up questions with a particular offeror, then this part of the session will not take place. The answers given in this session are part of the offeror’s oral presentation.

*d.* *Location.* The oral presentation sessions will be conducted by video chat, though audio may be substituted as needed. The Government will coordinate and set up the meeting space accordingly (providing dial in or links using a tool such as Acano or Adobe Connect).

*e.* *Date and Time.* The Government will schedule the date and time of the oral presentations with each offeror after the RFQ closing date and receipt of offeror quote submissions. The Government reserves the right to reschedule any offeror’s orals date at the discretion of the contracting officer.

*f.* *Participants.* Offerors may include as many participants as it feels is necessary. Offerors are advised to have technical personnel present since the Government will ask technical questions during the oral presentations. Type and number of participants included is at the offeror’s discretion and is the full responsibility of the offeror. All proposed Key Personnel currently employed by the offeror or its teaming partners shall attend the session - the Government is most interested in hearing from staff that will have a direct role in performing on the task. The letter(s) of intent and resume(s) will suffice for Key Personnel currently not employed by the offeror or its teaming partners.

> After the presentations, offerors shall provide an email to confirm
> attendance with names of participants to the meeting organizers.

**8. Basis of Award and Evaluation Criteria**

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4,
Federal Supply Schedules. This is not a FAR Part 15, Contracting by
Negotiation, procurement. All submissions in response to this RFQ are
considered quotations and not proposals or offers, even if labeled as
such. The offerors agree to and are bound by all instructions,
procedures and rules of this RFQ. The Government is not obligated to
determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, solicit final
revised quotations, and use other techniques associated with FAR part
15. The contracting techniques associated with FAR Part 15 do not apply.

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value
principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be
made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose
quotation provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price
and other factors considered.

The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and
management capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall
price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at
a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior
technical value. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation
factors combined are significantly more important than price.

*a.*  *Evaluation Process.* The Government intends to utilize a
    multi-phased approach for this procurement as described below. To be
    considered for award, offerors must successfully pass through
    each phase.

> **Phase 1 (Pass/Fail):** Quote Compliance Check - A compliance check
> will be conducted to ensure that offerors submit a complete technical
> quotation and a price quotation following the instructions set on this
> RFQ letter. Only the offerors that receive *Pass* will advance to
> Phase 2.
>
> **Phase 2 (Adjectival):** Technical Compliance Check - Review of
> Written Technical Quotations to ensure that offerors meet technical
> requirements as outlined in the RFQ and the PWS. Only the six (6)
> highest rated offerors, with *Acceptable* rating or higher, will
> advance to Phase 3.
>
> **Phase 3 (Adjectival):** Oral Interview - Offerors that are
> considered in Phase 3 will be notified of the time and date of the
> oral interview. The oral interview will be focused on the offeror’s
> experience and skills with open source software development,
> human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.
>
> **Phase 4:** Pricing Schedule and Pricing Narrative Check - Review of
> Price Quotations.

*b.* *Technical Evaluation Factors.* The Government will evaluate Phase 2 and Phase 3 for an offeror’s performance or capability acceptability based on the following non-price technical factors which are of equal importance to each other:

-   **Technical Understanding and Approach:** The Government will
    evaluate the offeror’s technical approach: level of knowledge,
    technical expertise, and overall understanding of the requirement.
    The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s skills with open
    source software development, human-centered design, and continuous
    deployment methods.

-   **Staffing Plan:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s
    proposed staffing methodology and skill levels/labor categories as
    well as the availability and relevant work experience demonstrated
    by Key Personnel.

-   **Similar Experience:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s
    experience in performing projects of similar scope and complexity.
    The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s experience with open
    source software development, human-centered design, and continuous
    deployment methods.

*c.* *Price Evaluation Factors.* Each offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the technical quotation and oral interview. The Government will evaluate the offeror’s pricing schedule as well as pricing narrative after the Oral Interview to ensure that the offered price is fair, reasonable, and realistic. Pricing shall reflect reasonableness, consistency with industry standards, and be in compliance with rates and terms and conditions of the aBPA. Note that as submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the evaluated price becomes more important. Therefore, provide your best discounted rates.

*d.* *Scoring Plan*

The evaluation of Phase 1 above shall be accomplished using the
Pass/Fail method.

The evaluation of Phase 2 and Phase 3 above shall be accomplished using
the adjectival scoring method, for which definitions are provided below:

> **Outstanding: (O)** – Very significantly exceeds and/or addresses all
> of the elements of the evaluation factors. With respect to the
> evaluation factor, the response surpasses an “Exceeds” rating. The
> offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of
> the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality and
> cost effective performance is anticipated.
>
> **Exceeds: (E)** – Fully meets and/or addresses most elements of the
> evaluation factors. With respect to the evaluation factor, the
> response exceeds an “Acceptable” rating. The areas in which the
> offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high
> level of efficiency, performance and/or quality and cost
> effectiveness.
>
> **Acceptable: (A)** – Meets and/or addresses many elements of the
> evaluation factors. With respect to the evaluation factor, the
> response is considered comprehensive and exemplifies an understanding
> of the scope and depth of the requirements as well as the offeror’s
> understanding of the Government’s requirements.
>
> **Unacceptable: (U)** – With respect to the evaluation factor, the
> technical response has many deficiencies and/or omissions and does not
> adequately address the evaluation factor.
